| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/health` | Model and engine readiness |
| GET | `/api/overview` | Cohort summaries, patient rows and actual versioned mean-risk history |
| GET | `/api/patients?q=&risk=` | Patient search and category filtering |
| GET | `/api/patients/{id}?version=` | Latest or immutable historical twin; includes all three prediction outputs |
| GET | `/api/patients/{id}/history?limit=48` | Observations and persisted prediction history |
| GET | `/api/patients/{id}/versions` | Version ledger |
| GET | `/api/patients/{id}/explanation?horizon=72` | Real drivers, patient-relative deviations and previous-score deltas |
| POST/GET | `/api/patients/{id}/scenarios` | Calculate conditional branches / list saved results |
| GET | `/api/alerts?patient_id=` | Persisted alerts |
| PATCH | `/api/alerts/{id}` | Acknowledge or resolve; resolved records are immutable |
| POST/GET | `/api/patients/{id}/interventions` | Append/list clinician action logs |
| GET | `/api/validation` | Executed experiment metrics and chart data |
| GET | `/api/status` | Cache freshness, provenance, model checksum, persistence and safety |
| GET | `/api/replay` | Replay cursor and reproducible demo metadata |
| POST | `/api/replay/step` | Advance 1–72 hours, transactionally |
| POST | `/api/replay/start` / `/pause` | Timed replay lifecycle |
| POST | `/api/replay/reset` | Destructive deterministic reset, default 24h primed history |
| WS | `/api/ws` | Twin/alert invalidation events and ping/pong |

Scenario body: `{"pm25_change_pct":-30,"adherence":0.95,"activity_multiplier":1.0}`. Ranges: PM2.5 −80 to +100%; adherence 0–1; activity 0.5–1.5. Unknown keys, non-finite values and out-of-range inputs are rejected. A `baseline_72` value at trajectory time 72 means the 72h horizon model evaluated at projected +72h, not cumulative original 72h risk.

Step body: `{"hours":12}`. Reset body: `{"prime_hours":24}` (optional target `hour`). Alert body: `{"status":"acknowledged","note":"Synthetic review"}`. Intervention body: `{"kind":"clinical_review","note":"Reviewed synthetic case"}`.

Errors: 404 missing patient/version/alert; 409 modification of resolved alert; 422 invalid assumptions/range/unsupported horizon or replay past end; 401 missing/incorrect configured demo admin token. Server errors are not replaced by fabricated outputs.

Read-only APIs are intentionally unauthenticated for synthetic review. If `PRANAGUARD_ADMIN_TOKEN` is configured in `.env`, all write endpoints require `X-Demo-Token`. Enter it in System & data for the browser session or pass it to curl. This is a shared demo gate, not patient-grade authentication/RBAC. Do not deploy real data. The replay CLI reads its token from the shell environment; when using `.env`, export the variable before running the CLI.
