# Data provenance and access

## Real versus synthetic

| Component | Provenance | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Patient profiles and clinical history | Synthetic, seed 2026 | No real people, no hospital/EHR records |
| Physiology, wearable-style values, sleep, activity | Synthetic stochastic process | Not device measurements |
| Symptoms, adherence and outcome onsets | Synthetic | Not clinician-adjudicated exacerbations |
| Ambient PM2.5, PM10, NO2, O3 | Cached public Open-Meteo / CAMS global model product | Gridded ambient concentration, not personal exposure |
| Temperature and humidity | Open-Meteo Historical Weather API | Historical model/reanalysis context, not patient sensors |
| Model predictions and explanations | Executed fitted models | Synthetic proof-of-concept estimates |
| What-if trajectories | Recomputed model inference on projected feature paths | Non-causal sensitivity; no proven intervention effect |

The delivered cohort is 120 patients × 60 days × 24 hours = 172,800 rows from 2026-08-01 through 2026-09-29 UTC. There are 263 stochastic synthetic event onsets across the entire dataset, not 263 real exacerbations. Check [generation_manifest.json](../data/generation_manifest.json) for the actual seed and checksum.

Four demonstration locations are used: Pune (18.5204, 73.8567), Mumbai (19.0760, 72.8777), Delhi (28.6139, 77.2090), Bengaluru (12.9716, 77.5946). Eight successful API responses (air + weather per location), each with 1,440 hourly timestamps, were retrieved during this build. Exact URLs and access timestamps are recorded rather than guessed in [environment/manifest.json](../data/environment/manifest.json).

Open-Meteo documents CAMS global data at approximately 0.4° (~45 km) resolution and 3-hourly source resolution, exposed as hourly API values. These data cannot resolve indoor pollutants, travel, occupational exposure or actual inhaled dose. The cache is historical and MUST NOT be described as today's air quality. UTC is used throughout the application; no implicit Indian-local-time conversion is made.

## Transformations and restrictions

Raw responses are saved without alteration and verified by SHA-256. Generation joins UTC timestamps, renames fields and aligns ambient values to each city's synthetic profiles. Subject-level clinical inputs are synthetic. Missing wearable readings are generated independently at about 1.2% for four fields after baseline calibration; their exact realized counts are in the data. Ambient data are not backward-filled. Cache gaps cause a clear error.

`python -m scripts.fetch_environment` is an explicit network operation. Normal application startup, replay, training from the bundled cache and inference work offline. The cache is included under CC BY 4.0 with attribution; no restricted clinical dataset is redistributed.

If there is no cache, generation fails by default. `--allow-synthetic-environment` explicitly permits a labelled synthetic environmental fallback. It does not silently pretend generated values are real. The default 60-day generator requires 60 days of cache. Date-range/coverage mismatch is an error rather than recycling real dates without disclosure.

Historical atmospheric products may be revised and are not archived, as-issued production forecasts. Features only use current/past timestamps, but this experiment is retrospective and cannot establish as-of operational availability. No future realized environmental trajectory is supplied to prediction or scenario inference.
